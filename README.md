# JewelryShop. E-commerce
Study project of E-comerce jewelry.

## Business idea of the project
#### JFYI:For the base of the e-commerce was chosen almost random real jewelry shop.
### Users can:
- Browse catalog of the shop and go to the liked item page;
- Search products;
- Go to different pages of the market;
- Buy jewelry;
- Add to cart and other stuff;

### Admins can the same as users + manage the store, for example: 
- Check orders (including user info and order stuff);
- Delete products;
- Upgrade the product info;
- Add new products, etc;

All of them must go through the authentication process of course. There are only 2 options for authorization: admin, ordinal user. For registration is also provided functionality. Allmost all fields are filled by users are implemented with validation. The shop also has some UI, that doesn't look like something special (but it just **looks so**. Actually it's a real hell under the hood).

_Due to this project was made in studying purposes, it has many shortcomings in the implementation aspects. For example, I didn't implement size choicing functionality, money managing, changing status of the orders, some UI features and optimizations, more roles, profiles, support chat, adaptive layout and many many other things._

## The Project stack:
### The application is based on the MVC pattern
